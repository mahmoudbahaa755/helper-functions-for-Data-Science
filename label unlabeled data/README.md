## This code appears to be a Python script that performs image classification on a set of images and splits them into folders based on the predicted class.

## The script takes the following inputs:

### model_dir: The directory where the pre-trained model is stored.
### data_dir: The directory where the images to be classified are stored.
### new_data_dir: The directory where the classified images will be stored.
### classes: An optional parameter specifying the classes to classify the images into.
The script contains several functions that perform various tasks such as loading a trained model, creating new directories, classifying images, and splitting the images into folders based on their predicted class.

The load_trained_model() function loads the pre-trained model and returns it along with the input shape and the number of output classes. The create_new_files() function creates a new directory and subdirectories for each of the classes in the classification task. The classifier() function takes an image path and classifies it using the pre-trained model. The get_all_img_in_list() function returns a list of all the image files in the specified directory and a list of the classes to classify them into. Finally, the split_data_with_model() function loads the pre-trained model, retrieves the list of images to classify, and performs the classification. The images are then split into directories based on their predicted class using the shutil library.
